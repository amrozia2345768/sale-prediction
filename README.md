# sale-prediction
This project predicts product sales based on advertising budget using Machine Learning with Python.Help businesses understand how changes in marketing budgets (TV, Radio, Newspaper) impact future sales.
Build a Python-based app (using Streamlit) for real-time prediction, so that non-technical users can easily get insights.
Features:
Real-Time Sales Prediction based on user input
Interactive Web Application using Streamlit
ML Model Integration (Random Forest Regressor)
Visual Representation of Inputs (Bar Chart)
Model Accuracy Display (RÂ² Score)
Tabs UI:
